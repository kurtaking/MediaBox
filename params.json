Deploying an application on a AWS server and making it live<br>\r\n11. Creating an admin interface with statistics about traffic across the site<br>\r\n\r\nWe want to capture as many attributes as possible about your media to run queries and present your content back to you in the cleanest way possible.\r\nBy collecting user data, we will be able to create custom statistics and display it back to the user.\r\n\r\nThis is our first crack at it. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n####Incomplete Features:\r\n1. Session Tracking<br>\r\n2. Application Templates (html views for each page)<br>\r\n3. Responsive design<br>\r\n4. User Dashboard<br>\r\n5.

Make sure you have virtualenv, pip, and python installed\r\n2. Create a new virtual environment via <code>virtualenv venv</code>\r\n3. Activate virtual environment with <code>source venv/bin/activate</code>\r\n4. Once the virtual environment is activated, you may need to install some python packages. Run:<br>\r\n  <code>pip install django djangorestframework mysqlclient</code>\r\n5. Run <code>python3 manage.py migrate</code> and ensure no errors come up.\r\n6.
